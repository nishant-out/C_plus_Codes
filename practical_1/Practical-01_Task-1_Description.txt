1.	All compilation processes

This Code Helps us in understanding what happens inside the Compiler when we tries to compile our code

Phase 1:
          PreProcessor:   replaces macros And removes comments from our source code.
Phase 2:
          Compiler:       Converts our source code to assembly level and performs Syntax & Symantic Analysis( error checking )
Phase 3:
          Assembler:      Converts our Assembly code to machine code( low-level-lang. )
Phase 4:
          Linker:         takes one or more object files( machine code ) and combines them into a single executable file
