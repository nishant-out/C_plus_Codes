Task 1:

	Efficient program to Check if a number is prime or not:
		
		If number == 2:
			Then definitely it is a Prime number
			
		If number % 2 == 0:
			This is a Check for all Even numbers, As no Even number is Prime
			
		If number == 1:
			Then it is not a Prime Number
			
		//	Now we have to Only check for Odd numbers >= 3 
		
		Loop through 3 to sqrt( n ):
			
			Check if it is Divisible by any odd Number
				
				If YES then it is not a Prime number
				
			Increment the Loop +2 times in Every Iteration to get a Odd no. always
			
			
			
		If NO Odd number is a multiple of n :
		
			Then it is a Prime Numnber
